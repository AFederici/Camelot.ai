We've been able to see a pretty good overview of how the two prices compare, but the goal is really to understand one coin relative to the other.

For example, if at time t, the normalized price for Ethereum is 10, and Golem is at 9, then your output should be 0 for Ethereum and (9-10)/10 = -0.1 for Golem.\n",
