    "Oh no! A new, deadly virus named dogepox has recently escaped a research lab. Given how dangerous the new strain is, scientists have issued a global epidemic warning, putting the entire planet into panic! They've flown in a team of the world's best data scientists to track the spread of this disease, and you're one of them! \n",

    "In this module, you'll be carefully monitoring the spread of dogepox, helping humanity better understand the risk at hand. For this problem, everyone in the world has a unique, non-negative integer id number. Further, all time passes as discrete, integer time steps. In the beginning, only patient zero (with id = 0) has been infected. You will receive an array of interactions (in chronological order), each of which represents two people in the world coming into close proximity on some day.\n",
