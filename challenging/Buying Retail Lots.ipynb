    "As a first step to pinpointing the best store locations, you'd like to analyze the distribution of the district's population. Fortunately, you've already scraped some statistics on Watertown's residents from the district website and compiled the data into a pandas DataFrame. Each entry in the dataset df describes one residential building and includes the number of residents, bedrooms, and bathrooms, as well as the latitude and longitude (given as coordinates) of the dwelling:\n",

Your first task is to identify which rows have missing data in the function missing_rows. As output, print the row numbers which have one or more fields missing, in ascending order. Each row number should be printed on a separate line.\n",

For instance, dwellings with approximately the same coordinates, 3 beds, and 4 baths are likely to have similar numbers of residents.

Your function should take in two numpy arrays, train (with dimensions n x m) and test (also n x m) as well as k, the number of points to take into account when computing means. The \"target field\" (i.e., residents) is the first column, and each point's features (all numerical) are encoded in the remaining columns. The test array has NaN's placed in the target field. The strategy is:\n",
    "1. For each test data point, find the k training data points that are closest in terms of Euclidean distance. (Compute this using the four feature fields, excluding the first target column)\n",
