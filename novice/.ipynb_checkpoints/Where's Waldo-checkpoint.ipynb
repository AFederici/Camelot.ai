    "Oh no! Your friend has challenged you to a game of Where's Waldo on a very large, grayscale image--it's impossible to search for Waldo by eye alone. Luckily enough, you have a good idea of what the shirt Waldo is wearing looks like. Specifically, you know that the shirt's grayscale color value falls somewhere between 220 and 255, inclusive.\n",

As output, your function should print the values in the bit mask row by row, with one value per line.\n",
