    "Suppose you wanted to build a model to extend this data to be able to predict the number of stars or future books, so you no longer need to rely on black market data to make money. A commonly used technique is that of decision trees, and random forests.\n",

Then the entropy of that variable is E(X) = sum_{i=1}^n - p_i * log_2(p_i). You can think of entropy as inversely related to useful information, so to learn things from the data, you want to decrease entropy. \n",

We'll set a parameter cutoff, and encode books that have a title with strictly more characters than cutoff with 1, and 0 otherwise. We now have two variables. To get the new entropy, we iterate across the outcomes for number of stars, and take the weighted sum of the entropies of the title length: sum_{i=1}^5 p_i E(X_i). Here, X_i indicates the data points where the number of stars equals i. See the example for more details.\n",

    "You will write a function get_entropy(df, cutoff), that takes in a Pandas DataFrame containing the data scraped from the previous problem, with the addition of the book title. Your job is to print the entropy of the 2 fields: E(number of stars, length of title). \n",
